Secure Student Data Management API
This Express.js-based REST API provides secure student data management. Users can register, log in, and perform CRUD operations on student records. Each userâ€™s data is protected, and token-based authentication ensures secure access.

Features
User Registration and Authentication:
Users register using their email, name, and password.
Upon successful login, a session is created, and session data is stored.
Custom middleware ensures that only authorized users can access protected routes.
Token-Based Authentication:
Token authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
When a user logs in, a token is generated and sent to the client.
Subsequent requests include this token for authentication.
Student Data Management:
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for student data.
Each user can only access their own student records.
Middleware checks session data and token validity.
Access Limits:
Users can access data up to three times using their token.
